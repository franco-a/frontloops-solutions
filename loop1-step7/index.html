        The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something
        that runs deep within everyone, even though most people don't take the time to find
        someone who truly respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone
        to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much
        less than respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow
        is by showing respect.

        I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect?
        Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire
        to show them how highly they are valued
